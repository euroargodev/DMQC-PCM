# DMQC-PCM

The DMQC-PCM is a new quality control method based on machine learning. It uses a statistical classifier (a PCM: Profile Classification Model) to organize and select more appropriately reference data for the quality control of an Argo float. You will find a preliminary implementation of this method in the current repository.

The preliminary implementation workflow is structured in some Jupyter Notebooks and a OWC version including the PCM option.
